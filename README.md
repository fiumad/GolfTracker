# GolfTracker
This code keeps track of average score per 9 holes of golf, and tracks the balance remaining on a golf membership until you breakeven.



To run the code, make two files in the same directory as golftwo.cpp
name one of them "data.txt" and the other "scores.txt"
These files will serve as your ledger

Next, open the directory in the terminal, and enter these commands: (you must have a c++ compiler to run this)
g++ *.cpp -o golf
./golf

this will begin the process for your first entry in the ledger

before running, edit golftwo.cpp to include your specific course's prices so that the program's running balance is accurate.
